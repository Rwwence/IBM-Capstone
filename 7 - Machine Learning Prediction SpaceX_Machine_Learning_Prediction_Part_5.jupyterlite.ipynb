Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n",
